3️⃣ When Kafka helps performance indirectly:
Scenario	Explanation
Your system has bursty writes	Kafka buffers these bursts by queuing events before writing to MongoDB, avoiding DB overload spikes.
You want to offload heavy read workloads	Kafka can feed cached or pre-aggregated data to other services, reducing load on MongoDB.
You have multiple services reading/writing data	Kafka decouples services to avoid DB contention and reduce simultaneous complex queries.
